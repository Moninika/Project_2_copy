      <h3>
          Mixed-Race as a Strategy for Disempowerment    
      </h3>

      <p>
        In July 1857, Abby Guy sued for the freedom for herself and her four children in the state of Arkansas. The court records state that she was a self-sufficient farmer, her children were educated and she was socially accepted by white families in her community. Essentially, the Guy family passed for white and wanted to assert their freedom in that regard.  The court required that the family be presented for physical inspection by the jury who would, based on their judgment decides based on their appearance such as skin color, hair, features, etc. whether or not they were black or white, free or slave.

      <h3>
        Not One Nor the Other, but "Other"   
    </h3>

    <p>
      The nature and degree of Ms Guy's and her children's "Otherness" was framed by the spectrum of "blackness" as was determned at the time. This was based on steriotypical and subjective biases which were legally supported by the term "mulatto" as a means of designating individuals as having twenty-five percent or more blac/negro ancestry as black.
