      <h3>
        The Civil Rights Movement     
      </h3>

      <p>
        During the 1950s, the struggle against racism and segregation entered mainstream American. For example, the landmark Brown v. Board of Education case in 1954, the Supreme Court declared that “separate educational facilities” for black children were “inherently unequal.” This ruling was the first nail in Jim Crow’s coffin.  
      </p>

      <p>
        Many Southern whites resisted the Brown ruling by withdrawing their children from public schools and enrolled them in all-white “segregation academies." They used violence and intimidation to prevent blacks from asserting their rights. In 1956, more than 100 Southern congressmen even signed a “Southern Manifesto” declaring that they would do all they could to defend segregation.    
      </p>
      
      <h3>
        The Japanese Internment    
      </h3>

      <p>
        Thousands of Japanese-American families were struggling to get their lives back after returning from internment camps - a result of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order 9066 which incarcerated people of Japanese descent, including U.S. citizens, from 1942 to 1945 - and still faced enormous resistance to co-existing in the same spaces as white Americans.
