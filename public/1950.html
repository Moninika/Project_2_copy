        The Civil Rights Movement     
      </h3>

      <p>
        During the 1950s, the struggle against racism and segregation entered mainstream American. For example, the landmark Brown v. Board of Education case in 1954, the Supreme Court declared that “separate educational facilities” for black children were “inherently unequal.” This ruling was the first nail in Jim Crow’s coffin.    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/1950s">read more</a>

      <p>
        Many Southern whites resisted the Brown ruling by withdrawing their children from public schools and enrolled them in all-white “segregation academies." They used violence and intimidation to prevent blacks from asserting their rights. In 1956, more than 100 Southern congressmen even signed a “Southern Manifesto” declaring that they would do all they could to defend segregation.       <a target="_blank" href="https://scholarcommons.sc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3764&context=etd">read more</a>

        The Continuing Legacy of the Japanese Internment    
      </h3>

      <p>
        When the Tomihiro family left Minidoka War Relocation Center in south-central Idaho in 1945, they didn’t head home to Portland, Oregon, where they’d lived for decades. “Home” didn’t exist anymore - they had lost everything during the internment of people of Japanese ancestry in World War II. Before the war, the family had owned a half-block of houses and stores and a hotel. Now, they had nothing.   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/united-states-forced-japanese-americans-into-internment-camps-here-how-started-over">read more</a>
