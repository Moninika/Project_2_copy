        Latasian or Cuveticanese?
        </h5>

        <p>

            My father was born in Fuzhou, Fujian Province, China in 1937. After surviving the Japanese invasion and the infighting between the various political factions, he moved to Berkeley, CA (via Taipei, Taiwan) in the 1950s. His Chinese-ness (which is initofitself fraught as a singular category) is based on a pre-1940’s experience in which Taiwan is a separate country from Mainland China, traditional Chinese characters were the textual language of the day, and contemporary China is as different from pre-communist China as, perhaps, America is from Britain. It is not the Chinese-ness of the contemporary country but one typical of a kind of diasporic existence which embodies/remembers a vastly different cultural context than what time has rendered.
        </p>
        <p>
            My mother was born in Basel, Switzerland in 1940 – a country diverse enough to have four official languages (French, German, Italian, and Romansch) and where citizens tend to hyphenate themselves to make cultural distinctions clear. She comes from a typical mid- 20thcentury middle class Swiss-German family – tending towards conservatism and consistency without foreclosing on new experiences. Growing up in Basel meant that her linguistic environment was rich with German, French, and English and that travel to the surrounding countries was easy and frequent. 
        </p>
        <p> 
            My mother was living temporarily in San Francisco working for the Del Monte Co as a secretary (intending to return to Basel after a couple years), when she met my father (who was finishing his PhD. in electrical engineering at UC Berkeley) at a dance in Squaw Valley, Lake Tahoe, CA in the 1960s. They were married in San Francisco, against threats of being disowned by their respective families and a few years before interracial marriage was legal across all the states. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I was born in Manhattan, NY in 1968, just one year after the 1967 Supreme Court decision that deemed anti-miscegenation state laws unconstitutional. I am, therefore, a first-generation Chinese-Swiss US citizen, holding dual citizenship from Switzerland, with cultural leanings more Swiss than Chinese (until my move to Shanghai in 2006) and more “third culture” than American. However, this is further complicated by the fact that I was adopted (born of a Chinese birth mother and a Cuban birth father). There never has been nor will there be a box for me to check. When making up my own category, I oscillate between Latasian (Latina+Asian) and Cuveticanese (Cuban+Helvetica+Chinese).

        <h5>
            Articulating Identity
            </h5>
        <p>
            However, even for those who seem to fit more neatly into one of the simplified boxes, for instance those who would be comfortable ticking “White” or “Black”, there is a disconnect between the abstracting and diminishing nature of categorization and the true complexity of our heritages; our ancestral origins and migrations; and the interweaving of histories and cultures. No category can articulate the ways in which we identify and relate to ourselves and others. This Alternative Census is meant to provide a space for individual agency - leaving room for self-identification beyond the spectrum of race/ethnicity/culture, entering into imaginative and personal ways of self-identification which speaks to the complexity of our heritages.
