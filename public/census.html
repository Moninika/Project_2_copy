            Mixed heritage people have often gone unrepresented in history. 
        </h5>
        <p>
            Though the reality is that most, if not all, people come from a background of mixed heritage, interracial marriages were not legalized across the whole United States until 1967. From the US Census Data it is diffciult to formulate a clear understanding of what social and political changes in regard to race meant for the mixed race and mixed heritage communities - the census did not allow for people to mark themselves with more than one race until the 2000 census and made no allowances for heritage/origins until 2020. Since these changes, the census has grown to accommodate 63 race categories - 57 of those are composed of mixed-race combinations. This shows how difficult it is to categorize humans through race as there are infinite possibilities in the racial composition of individuals.
        </p>

            <p>
                And, yet, the desire to categorise individuals, with intentional taxonomies, continues. How do systems and taxonomy on the US census reinforce and/or are reinforced by bias/racism? How does the census categories relate to notions of belonging?
            </p>
        
            <p>
                Is it possible to bring notions of fluidity and reinvention into a census and embrace an ever-changing state of being in order to subvert institutionalized categorizations? 
            </p>
