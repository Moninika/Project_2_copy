            Cubanese or Cubaveticanese, however, my adpoted status complicates this as I am culturally different from my ethnic background. Although my adopted father is ethnically and culturally Chinese (arriving in the US from China via Taiwan in the 1950s), my adopted mother is from Switzerland. As she was my primary caregiver, I am culturally and legally Swiss.
