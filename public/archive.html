It feels like something I have been conditioned to do.)

              <li><a href="#">Latasian or Cuveticanese , however, my adpoted status complicates this as I am culturally different from my ethnic background. Although my adopted father is ethnically and culturally Chinese (arriving in the US from China via Taiwan in the 1950s), my adopted mother is from Switzerland. As she was my primary caregiver, I am culturally and legally Swiss.
            </a></li>

            <li><a href="#">Eastern European mutt- I think- earthling</a></li>

            <li><a href="#"> I am a US citizen of European ancestry. I am not exactly sure about the precise location of my biological ancestors, because I am adopted. Some people have suggested Eastern Europe, because I have blond hair and blue eyes. It was almost certainly someplace with a significant Catholic population, because I was adopted through Catholic Charities. Both of my parents are/were of mixed Italian-German ancestry. We ate pasta all the time, but I did not feel much connection to German culture growing up. However, I *do* feel as though 1980s and 90s mainstream US popular culture were formative, and being from Buffalo, NY provided its own cultural touchstones--Go Bills! I moved to New York City in 2005, where I met and married a Chinese-American man who had grown up there. I am glad that I have been so accepted by his family and proud that I am now a "New Yorker" in my own right! My career as a university professor has taken me all over the US--and the world. My experiences living on both coasts, and in the the middle, of the USA--not to mention in UAE and China--have really helped me to appreciate the cultural diversity of America and the broader world. Ultimately, the story of how my maternal grandparents got together has always influenced my multicultural outlook. My grandmother was German-American and my grandfather was Italian-American. His family did not approve, so they eloped--how romantic!
