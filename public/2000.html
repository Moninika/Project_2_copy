        What (President Obama) is, in all his hyphenated hybridity, is a sign of a new world being born–not, certainly, the “another world is possible” of the anti-globalization movement, but another world of mingling and crossing borders, of making new ethnicities out of love across old divides.

    "A waitress asked: "Where are you from?" I told her my great-grandfather came to work the mines in New Mexico. My grandfather was a tailor in Oakland and my mother was born in Stockton.
