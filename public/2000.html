      <p>
        Self declaration: From the first US census in 1790 until 1960, people could not select their own race. The census takers, or enumerators, determined your race through their estimations based on the input of the head of household.  
      </p>
    
      <p>
      Suppressing Information: In the 1850s, census planners suppressed information about slavery at the behest of southern legislators; in the 1880s, the census director promoted nativist theories of race suicide; and in the 1940s, census officials helped plan Japanese internment. 
      </p>

      <p>
          Mixed Parentage: Persons of mixed racial parentage are classified according to the race of the non-white parent, and mixtures of nonwhite races are classified according to the race of the father. It was not until 2000 that US citizens could choose more than one race to describe themselves, allowing for an estimate of the nation’s multiracial population.
        </p>

        <p>
          Exanded Terminology: In 2020, for the first time, the form asks respondents who choose white or black for their race to give more information about their origins – for example, German, Lebanese, African American or Somali.
        </p>

        <p>
          This Alternative Census is meant to provide a space for individual agency - leaving room for self-categorization beyond the spectrum of race/ethnicity/culture, entering into imaginative ways of self-identification (i.e. LatinX + Asian = “Latasian” 
          or "White-Irish-German-American-Texan-Austinite-HillCountryAdjacent-Wandering”).
