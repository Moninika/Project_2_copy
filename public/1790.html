      <h3>
        The First Census
      </h3>
      
      <p>
        The first census began more than a year after the inauguration of President Washington and shortly before the second session of the first Congress ended. Congress assigned responsibility for the 1790 census to the marshals of the U.S. judicial districts under an act which, with minor modifications and extensions, governed census taking through 1840. The law required that every household be visited, that completed census schedules be posted in "two of the most public places within [each jurisdiction], there to remain for the inspection of all concerned..." and that "the aggregate amount of each description of persons" for every district be transmitted to the president.  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.census.gov/history/pdf/1790overview.pdf">read more</a>

      <h3>
        Three-Fifths a Man
      </h3>
      <p>
        In 1790, slaves were included in the census count (the three-fifths clause) because slaveholding states had made this a nonnegotiable condition for joining the Union in order to increase their population numbers. The result was a power bonus for Southern states in the new Congress and in the Electoral College. The nationâ€™s first decision about how to classify the population racially had immense policy consequences that lasted well into the twentieth century.  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amacad.org/publication/racial-classification-america">read more</a>

      <h3>
        Enumeration
      </h3>
      <p>
        The six inquiries in 1790 called for the name of the head of the family and the number of persons in each household of the following descriptions:
      </p>
      <p>
        Free White males of 16 years and upward (to assess the country's industrial and military potential) 
      </p>
      <p>        
        Free White males under 16 years
      </p>
      <p>
        Free White females
      </p>
      <p>
       All other free persons
      </p>
      <p>
        Slaves
      </p>

      <p>
        From this first US census in 1790 until 1960, people could not select their own race. The census takers, or enumerators, determined your race through their estimations based on the input of the head of household. In 1960, the census bureau mailed forms to households rather than collected information through enumerators in person, thereby giving the opportunity to individual to self-identify.   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.census.gov/history/www/through_the_decades/census_instructions/">read more</a>
