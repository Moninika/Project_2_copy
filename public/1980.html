          Undocumented Aliens      
      </h3>

      <p>
        Prior to January 1986, the Census Bureau's postcensal population estimates included no allowance for undocumented immigration. The 1980 Census estimates of that population based on the total number of estimated documented aliens and estimates of the number of aliens legally residing in the US. The difference between the two estimates was assumed to be the result of undocumented aliens being included n the census. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/1986/09/rpt2full.pdf">read more</a>

      <h3>
        "Arab" Americans    
    </h3>

    <p>
      No single term encompasses all Americans of Middle Eastern/West Asian/North African descent, but the official category used by the United States (US) Census and other agencies is ‘Arab Americans’. However, while they were not profiled in the 2010 Census, nor will be in the next census in 2020
    </p>
    <p>
      By the late 1980s, the US cut back the number of Middle Eastern immigrants it accepted. Many recent immigrants are alienated by prevailing attitudes and have limited contact with longer-established, more assimilated Arab–American communities. Linguistic barriers have also blocked their social and economic advancement. On average, however, Arab Americans in the twenty-first century are better educated, more prosperous and more politically active than the average American.

    <h3>
      Black America in the 1980s: Rhetoric Vs. Reality     
  </h3>

  <p>
    From bare human necessities to basic civil rights, the status of Black America is worse in the 1980s than it was in the 1960s. Even gone are the futile promises of a bankrupt national agenda promoting racial equality.
