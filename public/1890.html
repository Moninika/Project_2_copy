        Disfranchisement      
      </h3>

      <p>
        In the 1890s, each Southern state passed constitutional amendments placing stipulations on voting that hit African Americans hardest. There were three main ways of doing this: poll taxes, property tests and literacy tests. Property tests made it illegal to vote unless you owned property. The poll tax simply put a tax on voting. Poll taxes, now illegal, clearly had a discouraging effect on voting by poor people.  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4p2957.html">read more</a>

        Segregation by Law      
    </h3>

    <p>
      The segregation and disenfranchisement laws known as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/podcasts/retropod/jim-crow-and-the-rise-of-blackface-1/">"Jim Crow"</a>  represented a formal, codified system of racial apartheid that dominated the American South for three quarters of a century beginning in the 1890s. The laws affected almost every aspect of daily life, mandating segregation of schools, parks, libraries, drinking fountains, restrooms, buses, trains, and restaurants. "Whites Only" and "Colored" signs were constant reminders of the enforced racial order.     <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/freedom-riders-jim-crow-laws/">read more</a>

          The Chinese Problem    
    </h3>
      <p>
        The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was the first significant law restricting immigration into the United States. Many Americans on the West Coast attributed declining wages and economic ills to Chinese workers. Although the Chinese composed only .002 percent of the nation's population, Congress passed the exclusion act to placate worker demands and assuage prevalent concerns about maintaining white "racial purity."   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.history.com/topics/immigration/chinese-exclusion-act-1882">read more</a>
