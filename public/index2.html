            How is (racial) identity both shaped and perceived by the categorizations, hierarchies, and absences included/not included on the US census?

            What motivations are inherent in these institutionalized choices and by whom (who are the stakeholders)?

            How does racism/bias and the US census reinforce one-another?

            From the first US census in 1790 until 1960, people could not select their own race. The census takers, or enumerators, determined your race through their estimations based on the input of the head of household.  It was not until 2000 that US citizens could choose more than one race to describe themselves, allowing for an estimate of the nation’s multiracial population. In 2020, for the first time, the form asks respondents who choose white or black for their race to give more information about their origins – for example, German, Lebanese, African American or Somali.
