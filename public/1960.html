          Resistance      
      </h3>

      <p>
        from 1964 to 1968, more than a hundred American cities were swept by race riots, which included dynamitings, guerrilla warfare, and huge conflagrations, as the anger of the northern black community at its relatively low income, high unemployment, and social exclusion exploded. At this violent expression of hopelessness the northern white community drew back rapidly from its reformist stance on the race issue (the so-called white backlash).

<h3>
  The Asian American Experience
</h3>
      <p>
        The 1965 immigration reform that passed as part of civil rights legislation abolished quotas that previously restricted non-Northern European immigration, but it would still be decades before record numbers of immigrants from Asia, Latin America, and other non-Western countries would arrive.
