          The New Model Minority      
      </h3>

      <p>
        In 1965, the United States Congress liberalized laws that severely restricted Asian immigration.  The Immigration Reform Act of 1965 was framed as an amendment to the 1952 McCarran-Walter Act, under which a quota system giving preference to skilled laborers and relatives of US citizens was articulated . This legislative action made a tremendous change. While there were only a few thousand Asian-Indians living in the United States in the 1960’s, by the mid 1980s, over 300,000 Asian Indians had emigrated from India.  <a target="_blank" href="http://people.bu.edu/prothero/ia_immigrants.htm">read more</a>

    <h3>
      The Asian American Experience
    </h3>
      <p>
        There was a term for (Asian Indian Americans') place in the country’s racial order: model minority. The concept is generally traced to a 1966 article in The New York Times Magazine by the sociologist William Petersen, which focused on Japanese Americans; the basic idea was extended to other Asian Americans. Of course, the notion of “model minorities” comes with a flip side—“problem minorities.” The terminology took on life at a time of intense social unrest: race riots across the country, the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., the emergence of Richard Nixon’s racially charged “southern strategy.” Many Americans were losing what faith they may have had in the possibility of racial equality.       <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/01/the-making-of-a-model-minority/617258/">read more</a>
