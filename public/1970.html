        What did it all mean?  Was the Chicago Eight Trial merely, as one commentator suggested, "a monumental non-event"?  Was it, as others argue, an important battle for the hearts and minds of the American people?  Or is it best seen as a symbol of the conflicts of values that characterized the late sixties?  These are some of the questions that surround one of the most unusual courtroom spectacles in American history, the 1969-70 trial of eight radicals accused of conspiring to incite a riot at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. <a target="_blank" href="http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/Chicago7/Account.html">read more</a>

        Towards a Black Agenda: The Gary Declaration at the first National Black Political Convention    
      </h3>
      <p>
        "So when we turn to a Black Agenda for the seventies, we move in the truth of history, in the reality of the moment. We move recognizing that no one else is going to represent our interests but ourselves. The society we seek cannot come unless Black people organize to advance its coming. We lift up a Black Agenda recognizing that white America moves towards the abyss created by its own racist arrogance, misplaced priorities, rampant materialism, and ethical bankruptcy. Therefore, we are certain that the Agenda we now press for in Gary is not only for the future of Black humanity, but is probably the only way the rest of America can save itself from the harvest of its criminal past."  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/gary-declaration-national-black-political-convention-1972/">read more</a>  (p744)

        New Waves of Immigration
      </h3>
      <p>
        More than 41 million immigrants lived in the U.S. as of 2013, more than four times as many as was the case in 1960 and 1970. By comparison, the U.S.-born population is only about 1.6 times the size it was in 1960. Immigrant population growth alone has accounted for 29% of U.S. population growth since 2000.  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/hispanic/2015/09/28/chapter-5-u-s-foreign-born-population-trends/">read more</a>

        Construction of Visual Culture
      </h3> 
      <p>
        "Despite the variety and the differences, and however much we proclaim the contrary, what the media produce is neither spontaneous nor completely “free:” “news” does not just happen, pictures and ideas do not merely spring from reality into our eyes and minds, truth is not directly available, we do not have unrestrained variety at our disposal. 
      </p>
      <p>
        For like all modes of communication, television, radio, and newspapers observe certain rules and conventions to get things across intelligibly, and it is these, often more than the reality being conveyed, that shape the material delivered by the media. ”  ― Edward Said
