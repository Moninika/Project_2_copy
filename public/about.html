        Harvest is a version of the Surrealist Equisite Corpse form, consists of truncated parts of biological creatures and plants (representing those harvested by  pharmaceutical companies) as well as cultural artifacts/objects (representing the areas from which the bio-matter is harvested) which can be pieced together to form new assemblages. These assemblages can be analyzed to determine the origin of the elements, information about the bio organisms themselves (what they eat, other data), their individual compounds, their pharmaceutical use, as well as the outcome of their surrealist recipes by referring to accompanying material.
