      <h3>
        The Census and its Affordances
      </h3>
      <p>
        As a political construct, a census not only reflects the ideological orientation of its creators but is also a stratgey for their various agendas. In each period, the meaning and uses of the census reflects the politics and priorities of the moment which is influenced by the particular Nantion State in question as well as global neo-liberal concerns more broadly.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Self declaration
      </h3>
      <p>
         From the first US census in 1790 until 1960, people could not select their own race. The census takers, or enumerators, determined your race through their estimations based on the input of the head of household.  
      </p>
    <h3>
      Suppressing Information
    </h3>
      <p>
        In the 1940s, census officials helped plan and execute Japanese internment. In the 1850s southern legislators successfully pressured census planners to suppress information about slavery. In the 1880s, the census director promoted theories of "race suicide"- setting the foundation for cultural and race stereotypes and corresponding welfare and economic policies still prevalent today. 
        </p>
    <h3>
      Mixed Parentage
    </h3>
      <p>
          Persons of mixed racial parentage are classified according to the race of the non-white parent, and mixtures of nonwhite races are classified according to the race of the father. It was not until 2000 that US citizens could choose more than one race to describe themselves, allowing for an estimate of the nation’s multiracial population.
        </p>
      <h3>
        Exanded Terminology
      </h3>
        <p>
          In 2020, for the first time, the census form invites respondents who choose white or black for their race to give more information about their origins – for example, German, Lebanese, African American or Somali.
        </p>
      <h3>
        New Possibilities
      </h3>
        <p>
          This Alternative Census is meant to provide a space for individual agency - leaving room for self-categorization beyond the spectrum of race/ethnicity/culture, entering into imaginative ways of self-identification - such as LatinX + Asian = “Latasian” 
          or "White-Irish-German-American-Texan-Austinite-HillCountryAdjacent-Wandering”.
